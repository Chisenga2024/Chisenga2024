            The main lifts are the main compound exercises for 
            any powerlifting or strength training workout program.
            The Big 3 are the squat, bench press and deadlift. 
            The Squat is known as the “King of All Exercises” because it builds muscle mass throughout your entire body and 
            tests your full body strength all in one powerful lift.
            The Bench Press and Deadlift have their own place in the strength world, 
            but having a big squat makes you King and Queen to others
