               First, the bench press is NOT just an upper body lift.
               Though it focuses on your upper body, you must use your entire body as one unit to lift the most weight safely and effectively.
               The biggest part of this is simply set up in a position that puts the least amount of stress on your shoulders and 
               helps you to maintain stability as you lift.
               Most problems with the bench press come from simply not setting up in the proper position to lift from, 
               resulting in instability while you lift and high shoulder stress
