            The Deadlift is one of the most brutal and beneficial lifts there is.
            It is brutal because you have to lift a heavy weight from a dead stop, starting in a disadvantaged position.
            But it is so beneficial because it improves ALL of your other lifts!
            The Deadlift builds muscle mass throughout your entire body and tests your full body strength like nothing else can.
            Nothing can improve your hip, core, back, and grip strength as much as deadlifts.
            And nothing can replace it.
            If you have a strong deadlift, then you probably have a brutally strong body from head to toe!
            It is such a simple lift, yet so hard that very few people actually do them. 
            Not to mention that many gyms don’t allow deadlifts, or have terrible set-ups for them.
            If that is your gym, then I highly recommend you go somewhere else that actually promotes strength and 
            doesn’t hold you back from reaching your goals
